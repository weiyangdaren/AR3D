## How to run

### Environment
We provide a Dynamic Libraryï¼Œ It is compiled in the environment we use TITAN RTX, Ubuntu16.04. Docker or installing the same CUDA and OpenCV version would be necessary.

```shell
python=3.8
pytorch=1.10.1
torchvision=0.11.2
opencv=3.4.12
cuda=10.2
cudnn=7.6.5
```

### Preparation
```shell
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit
pip install spconv-cu102
cd utils/iou3d_nms
python setup.py develop
```

### Run test
```shell
python test.py
```
